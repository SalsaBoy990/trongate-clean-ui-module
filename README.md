_Almost production-ready._


## Install the Clean.UI Trongate module

1. Copy the `ui` folder into your `modules` folder of your Trongate project.

2. Copy the `clean.php` into your `templates\views` folder of your Trongate project.

3. Add this method to your `templates/controllers/Templates.php` file:

```php
    function clean($data) {
        load('clean', $data);
    }
```

4. The Clean CSS demo with useful components will be accessible at: `http://localhost/{your_project_folder_name}/ui`


## After install / Get Started

Go to `modules\ui\clean\` folder.
You can either use gulp or make to generate your css and js bundles.

### Gulp setup (all OS)

Install the cli (globally):
```bash
npm -g install gulp-cli
```

Install nmp packages:
```bash
npm i
```

**Inspect `gulpfile.js`.**

```bash
gulp styles
```

Generate JS bundle:
```bash
gulp scripts

- Compile sass to css in watch mode: `make sass-watch`
